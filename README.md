# Milestone 4 project - PARdesigns

I created this app as a final project for The Full Stack Development Course. 
This app represents a graphic designer online business.
This website is design to clearly present a graphic design portfolio so teh visitor who is looking for a graphic design service can easily search the different types of services provided, can clearly see examples of the designer's work before decidin to purchase a service package from the designer.
Prices will vary according to the simplicity or size of the project. Extra features are available for purchasing and will increase the value of the service package.

## UX

This website meants to have a clear display of a graphic designer's porfolio and a easy way of choosing and paying for the service required.
Users can search the services provided by the designer and filter the results to match their needs. They will see examples of the final result, examples of the work the designer created for previous clients.
The user will be able then to choose the exact service they need and pay for it. Users can register an account. On their profile can see their order history, their personal details which can be updated. They can also post testimonials as feedback for the services received when logged in.
